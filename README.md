# YouTube To MP3

This is a small Python 3 program that turns YouTube URLs into MP3 files on your machine. To run it, download this project as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/KINGTUT10101/YouTube-To-MP3/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract the files into a folder, download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows), extract its items into the same folder, and run the BAT file. You can paste links into the prompt by using shift+ctrl+v. To quit the program, use ctrl+c.

After you've completed the set up, your project folder should look something like this:

To use this program, you will need Python 3.11, pytube, and pydub installed. Pydub was needed to fix an issue with inconsistent sample rates that prevented me from using the songs in PowerBeatsVR.
